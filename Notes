pop/peek may return an EOS which results in type mismatch. Ensure this is okay...DONE

catch all in node...DONE

check for main dfa..DONE

check for name collisions when making dfas ... DONE

check for start state within a  node...DONE

check for transitions...DONE

return/transition mutually exclusive ... DONE

return or catch all ... DONE

add state() dfa/function for concurrency purposes ... DONE

add push/pop/peek to code gen ... DONE

make it so that all dfas are logged in the dfa_lookup table before evaluation

make it so that callDFA code gens empty args correctly

make it so that dfas in lookup dont' get "self" appended

enforce returnVal, nexT, and now as unoverwriteable keywords
