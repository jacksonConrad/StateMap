pop/peek may return an EOS which results in type mismatch. Ensure this is okay...DONE

catch all in node...DONE

check for main dfa..DONE

check for name collisions when making dfas ... DONE

check for start state within a  node...DONE

check for transitions...DONE

return/transition mutually exclusive ... DONE

return or catch all ... DONE

add state() dfa/function for concurrency purposes ... DONE

add push/pop/peek to code gen ... DONE

main dfa return void ... DONE

make it so that callDFA code gens empty args correctly ... DONE

make it so that dfas in lookup dont' get "self" appended ... DONE

enforce returnVal, nexT, and now, dfaDict as unoverwriteable keywords ... DONE

sub-dfa's not callable ... Make sure sub-dfas are defined first ... DONE

add self.nexT = None under returnVal once a DFA ends ... DONE

semantically check dfas in concurrency

enforce that concurrent returns only strings ... DONE

add string-to-int/float/input ... DONE

ensure main DFA has return type void ... DONE

add stacks to command-line inputs ... DONE

iterate over command-line args and cast them into appropriate types ... DONE
